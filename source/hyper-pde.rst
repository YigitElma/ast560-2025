Section 2: Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations
----------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   `PDF of Notes of Hyperbolic PDEs <./_static/hyper-pdes.pdf>`_.

   This is a work in progress and I will update them as we go along in
   this part of the course.


   The `homework for this part of the course
   <./_static/hw-hyper-pdes.pdf>`_.  is posted. This is due *Tuesdat
   April 8th 2025*. Ideally, write the solution usig LaTeX. You can
   simply copy the homework LaTeX files checked into the `Github repo
   <https://github.com/ammarhakim/ast560-2025/tree/main/notes/hyper-pdes>`_
   and used that as a starting point. Freely copy the LaTex from the
   notes at the same Github directory also.
