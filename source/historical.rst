Some Historical Notes

On Charles Baggage
++++++++++++++++++

The first and perhaps greatest pioneer in computer hardware was
`Charles Babbage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage>`_. He
essentially, ab-inito, designed a series of mechanical computers,
culminating in the Analytical Engine. Most of Babbage's machines were
not built in his lifetime. However, his design for the Analytical
Engine contains all the modern architectural details found in our
processors (of course, Babbage worked with mechanical machines and not
electronics). By a stroke of misfortune (probably as Babbage never
published anything), Babbage's ideas were not widely known, and
especially his designs fell into obscurity. They were only
rediscovered in 1960s, much after the modern von Neumann architecture
was designed. That two independent designs made a century apart should
be so similar is remarkable.

`Allan Bromley <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_G._Bromley>`_ is
the credited for rediscovering Babbage's legacy. See his `paper
<./_static/Bromley-1982.pdf>`_ in Annals of the History of Computing
for a detailed overview of the Analytical Engine. Babbage's Difference
engine has been built twice now. See `Computer History Museum page
<https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/>`_. Babbage also designed an
extraordinary printer which was also built by the Science
Museum. London. See `BBC news report

Album of Fluid Motion
+++++++++++++++++++++

Fluid flows can be extremely rich, displaying complex and highly
nontrivial behavior. Of course, fluid and plasma turbulence remains a
major open problem. A while ago, van Dyke created a book called "Album
of Fluid Motion" is an excellent source of beautiful pictures of fluid
flow. See `this link for a PDF of an older version
<http://courses.washington.edu/me431/handouts/Album-Fluid-Motion-Van-Dyke.pdf>`_
of the book. A good summer project would be to see how many of these
pictures you can reproduce with computer simulations!
