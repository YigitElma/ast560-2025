Readings on Plasma & Self-Gravitating Systems Kinetic Theory
------------------------------------------------------------

For a detailed course on plasma kinetic theory please see the web-page
of the `Kinetic Theory Course
<http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/KT/>`_
taught by Dellar, Schekochihin, and Fouvry. In particular, see
`Schekochihin's notes
<https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/KT/2015/KTLectureNotes.pdf>`_. 

The statistical mechanics of self-gravitating system is rather
different from plasmas as gravitational "charge" (i.e. mass) comes
only in a single "sign" (i.e. positive). See `Fouvry's notes
<http://www2.iap.fr/users/fouvry/files_teaching/KineticTheory_Oxford_Notes.pdf>`_
for this important case of Vlasov-Poisson equations.
